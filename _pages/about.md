I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at Columbia University, and I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Adam N. Elmachtoub](https://www.columbia.edu/~ae2516/). My research interest lies in fairness, revenue management, and data-driven decision-making.

I received my MS degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) where I was advised by Prof. [Il-Chul Moon](https://aai.kaist.ac.kr/). Prior to that, I received my BS degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering and Electrical Engineering from KAIST.
